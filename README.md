### Data

- **Word List**: 

    [This list](https://www.randomlists.com/data/words.json) was used as supplied by [this StackOverflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/594273/how-to-pick-a-random-english-word-from-a-list)

    Using MS Word I manually removed all words containing "-" to simplify the game functionality. Also, I adapted the spelling to UK English where it originally differed. 

### Code
